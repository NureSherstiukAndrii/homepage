                I'm Andrii, a frontend developer with a desire to develop in this sphere and become
                a qualified specialist. I have excellent communication skills and easily adapt to a
                new team, also well-developed skills of analytics and problem-solving. I have a lot
                of projects behind me that were developed from start to finish using different technologies.
                Some of them were created in a team of several developers. So I am constantly learning
                new techniques and practicing them as much as possible.

                      Hello! Glad to see, I'm pleased that you are here,
                      because this is where my journey in IT began &#128522;

                    <span>
                      During Covid, when I was in 10th grade, I thought for a long time about who
                      I would like to become, which made me feel morally bad &#128531; My eye fell on programming,
                      namely the front-end part, because I liked to see beautiful sites. While studying it,
                      I began to feel better and realized that I wanted to devote myself to this field.
                      I had to stop studying a bit due to exams :(

                      6 people participated in this project. I was the only one who knew how to work with the
                      front-end and a little with the back-end and took on the role of team lead. When
                      distributing tasks, some guys did not want to complete the tasks or completed them
                      for a very long time and we always had to remind them (I looked like this -
                      <button id="toggleButton" onclick="toggleImage()">Open :)</button>). In the end,
                      I did most of the work and I can say that it greatly improved my skills. I felt like
                      a superhero heh &#129497; and was happy like this cat,

                      My first big project made using more modern technologies. Having created a large function,
                      I was at a loss as to how I would do it (My honest reaction -
                      <button id="toggleCryCatButton" onclick="toggleCryingCat()">Open :)</button>).
                      I worked hard on it and spent a lot of time making it as good as possible. There were many
                      difficulties that I overcame and learned many techniques! I was proud of myself after
                      doing this project. &#128579;

                      After calling a few old friends, one of them invited me to participate in the event.
                      I was hesitant, as I knew the basis of one of the technologies they wanted to use,
                      but agreed. Unfortunately, the guys procrastinated on completing the tasks, which
                      made me a little angry &#128528;. I was glad that I used new technologies and added to my stack.
                      After a while, we finished the project and I was able to breathe. &#128517;

                      I was worried before the conversation even with the recruiter &#128551;, but I successfully
                      passed it and was incredibly happy!!! I had 4 days to prepare for the technical interview.
                      All this time I prepared diligently, but unfortunately I was refused. &#129319;
                      But I didn’t give up too much and started looking for advantages, such as new experience,
                      new features heard from experienced developers, and how work works in a real project. &#128578;
